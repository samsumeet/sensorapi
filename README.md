# sensorapi

1) I have used Springboot for creating Restfull API and have used Swaager UI for Automatic API Documentation.

2) Used a package structure like this ->
 ``` 
  sensor(main package)
  controller(rest api)
  service
  dao
  domain
  constants
 ```
3) I have embedded Db(H2).

4)  Test cases skelaton is created.
5) For Test Cases :
   ```
   a) We can use Wiremock for mocking server also
   b) Integration test cases also
    ```
    ```
    Note: I am writing this down because didnt get timne to write test cases.
    ```
